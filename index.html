    The goal of these pages is to gather feedback on different means of
    diagram navigation and modification using keyboard interaction. To be
    more concrete: I'm trying to find ways to create diagrams primarily
    for use in software development. Examples of these are Domain Models,
    Component Diagrams and Use-case diagrams.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea to build an editor grew out of frustration with existing
    solutions. The de facto solutions are optimized for point-and-click,
    with keyboard navigation being a second-class citizen. Sure they have
    shortcuts for most common operations, but the application was not
    designed with keyboard-only interaction in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having used vim extensively for the past decade, I sometimes miss it's
    power when manipulating non-textual documents, especially when I need
    to capture my thoughts as fast as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea here is to create several demos or spikes representing a
    specific interaction with a diagram. It's very much an exploration of
    efficient keyboard navigation for diagram manupilation.

    If you have any suggestions, examples or comments I'd be very
    interested in hearing them. My (probably incomplete) list of
    interactions to investigate:

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="double-column">
    <p>
      With these spikes I want to investigate and gather feedback about
      efficient diagram creation using the keyboard, as this is often
      considered a second-class citizen.

      Currently the list of completed spikes is very limited:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="navigation-hierarchical.html">Element traversal using diagram hierarchy</a></li>
      <li><a href="navigation-jump.html">Element traversal by jumping</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I hope to be able to add more experiments soon.

      If you have any suggestions, examples or comments I'd be very
      interested in hearing them. You can <a href="https://github.com/MelleB/ui-spikes/issues/new">open an issue</a> for general comments. The spike pages themselves have a simple Google Form embedded which you can use to send some quick feedback.
